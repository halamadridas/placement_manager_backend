# Placement Backend

This is a basic Node.js Express backend.

## Setup

1. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   Or for development with auto-reload:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

3. Visit [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see the server running.
